# SC2MPZ

sc2mpz is a file converter that transforms Sim City 2000 save files into a
generic gzip compressed [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) file format.

The converter is based on the [OpenCity2k](https://github.com/dfloer/OpenCity2k)
project and therefore has to retain an AGPL license.


## Usage

Download and run the binary for your platform. `sc2mpz -h` should provide you
with a list of possible options.


## Contribution

Anyone is welcome to contribute patches to increase the compatibility with sc2
files, as well as improving the export datasets.
